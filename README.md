The RottenPotatoes TMDb Integration project is aimed to improve my existing RottenPotato website by employing TDD for building out new functionalities.
Specifically, it focuses on adding features that allow users to look up movies using The Open Movie Database (TMDb) API. This project embraces the "code we wish we had" philosophy, driving development with tests written in RSpec, a Domain-Specific Language for testing Ruby code.

# Feature
TMDb Movie Search: Users can search for movies using TMDb.
RottenPotatoes Integration: Seamless integration of new features with the existing RottenPotatoes application.
RSpec Testing: Comprehensive unit and module-level tests using RSpec to ensure reliability and maintainability.

# Dependencies
Ruby on Rails (specifically Ruby version 2.6.6 with Rails 4.2.11)
RSpec for testing.
Guard for automating test workflow.
Faraday for making HTTP requests to TMDb.
Other gems needed for testing and development (rails-controller-testing, guard-rspec)
